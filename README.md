This is a simple background program that stays in tray and watches for changes of CensusPlusTBC.lua from the [CensusPlusTBC](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplustbc) WoW Classic interface addon.
When it detects a change, it automatically uploads the file to [wowclassicpop.com](https://wowclassicpop.com) where it gets processed and aggregated into a database.
